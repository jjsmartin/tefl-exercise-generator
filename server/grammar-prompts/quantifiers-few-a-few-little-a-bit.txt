Help the student understand the use of quantifiers 'few', 'a few', 'little', and 'a bit of' in English. These quantifiers are used differently with countable and uncountable nouns. 'A few' and 'few' are used with countable nouns, while 'a bit of' and 'very little' are used with uncountable nouns. The difference between 'few' and 'a few', and 'little' and 'a bit of' is also important to note. 'Few' and 'little' often imply a negative connotation (not enough), while 'a few' and 'a bit of' have a more positive or neutral connotation (some, but not a lot).
