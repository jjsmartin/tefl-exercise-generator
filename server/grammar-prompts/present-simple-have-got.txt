Help the student understand the usage of 'have got' in present simple tense. Explain that 'have got' is used in the affirmative, negative, and question forms. For example, in the affirmative, 'I've got a big family.' In the negative, 'We haven't got a garden.' In questions, 'Have you got any pets?' Also, teach them the short answers like 'Yes, I have.' or 'No, I haven't.' Make sure they understand the difference in usage between 'I/you/we/they' and 'he/she/it'. Finally, introduce the past tense form 'had got', as in 'I had got a red bike when I was young.'
