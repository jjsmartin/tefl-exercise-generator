Help the student understand the use of third and mixed conditionals in English. Third conditionals are used to imagine a different past and the result of that change. For example, "If I hadn't been ill, I would have gone to the party." Mixed conditionals are used when we imagine a past change with a result in the present or a present change with a result in the past. For instance, "If I hadn't got the job in Tokyo, I wouldn't be with my current partner" or "If it wasn't important, I wouldn't have called you on your holiday."
