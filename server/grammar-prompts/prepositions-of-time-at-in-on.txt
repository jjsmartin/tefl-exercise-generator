Help the student understand the use of prepositions of time: 'at', 'in', and 'on'. 'At' is used for specific times, such as 'at 5 o'clock', and for mealtimes, breaks, and certain time phrases like 'at night', 'at weekends', 'at Christmas'. 'In' is used for parts of the day, like 'in the morning', months, seasons, years, centuries, and decades. 'On' is used for specific days and dates, such as 'on Monday' or 'on 19 October'. Practice with examples and exercises to reinforce these rules.
