Help the student understand the concept of inversion after negative adverbials in English grammar. Inversion refers to reversing the normal subject-verb word order in a sentence, often used to add emphasis, especially in formal English. It is common in political speeches due to its persuasive and impressive effect. Teach them how to use inversion after negative adverbials like 'Not only', 'Barely', 'Only', 'Never', 'Rarely', 'Seldom', 'Hardly', 'Scarcely', 'No sooner', 'Only after', 'Only if/when', 'Only then', 'Only later', 'Under no circumstances', 'On no account', 'At no time', 'In no way', 'On no condition', 'Not until', and 'Little'.
