Adjectives and how they go together with certain prepositions.

For example, we say "tired of", "interested in", "good at", "different from", "similar to".

Mistakes often occur when learners use the wrong preposition after an adjective. A good exercise will check that the learner uses the correct preposition after an adjective. The exercise should therefore ask the student to choose between the correct preposition and several incorrect ones.

The important thing is the choice of preposition, not the choice of adjective. So the student should be choosing the preposition.
