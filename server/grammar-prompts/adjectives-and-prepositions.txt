The correct prepositions to be used with adjectives.

Here is an example of a good exercise: with the sentence "The captain was concerned about the safety of the passengers.", the question might be "The captain was ________ the safety of the passengers." with the correct answer being "concerned about" and the incorrect options being ["concerned for", "concerned of", "concerned at"]. The explanation would specify that 'about' is the correct preposition to use after 'concerned' when expressing worry or unease, and that 'of' is a common but incorrect choice in this context.
