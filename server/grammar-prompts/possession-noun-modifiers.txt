Help the student understand the concept of possession and noun modifiers in English. Teach them that possessives are used to indicate ownership, such as in "Nelson Mandela's words" or "the dogs' blankets". Explain that the possessive form can also be used with places or groups of people, time expressions, and the word 'life'. Additionally, teach them about noun modifiers, where the first noun acts as an adjective to modify the second noun, such as in "film night" or "winter months". Make sure they understand that noun modifiers can also indicate what something is made of or that one thing is part of something else.
