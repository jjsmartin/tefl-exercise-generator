Help the student understand that the passive voice is used to change the focus of a sentence. It is often used when the doer of the action is unknown, obvious, or not important, or when the most important or logical information should start the sentence. The passive voice is also common in formal or scientific writing. The structure of the passive voice is: Object + be + past participle. The verb 'be' changes according to the tense of the sentence. For example, in the present simple tense, we use 'is/are', in the past simple 'was/were', in the present perfect 'has/have been', and in the future simple 'will be'.
