Help the student understand that in English, verbs are often followed by specific prepositions, forming a combination that must be learned together as there are no grammatical rules to guide this pairing. For instance, 'agree with', 'listens to', and 'thanked for' are examples of verb-preposition pairs. Encourage students to note down new vocabulary in sentences or phrases to better remember these combinations. Some common prepositions used after verbs include 'for', 'from', 'in', 'of', 'on', 'to', and 'with', each having a set of verbs they commonly pair with.
