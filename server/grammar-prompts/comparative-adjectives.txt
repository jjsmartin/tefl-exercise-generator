Comparative adjectives

Help the student understand how adjectives can be used to compare two things or states of affairs. The student should also understand how the comparative form of an adjective is written. For example, "big" becomes "bigger" with two consonants. "Roomy" becomes "roomier" with 'i' not a 'y'.
