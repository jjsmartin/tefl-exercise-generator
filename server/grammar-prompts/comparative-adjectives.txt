Help the student understand that comparative adjectives are used to compare two things or show change. The form of the comparative adjective depends on the number of syllables in the adjective. For adjectives with one syllable, we add "-er" to the end (e.g., old becomes older). If the adjective ends in a vowel and a consonant, we usually double the consonant before adding "-er" (e.g., big becomes bigger). For adjectives with two or more syllables, we add "more" before the adjective (e.g., crowded becomes more crowded). There are also irregular adjectives like good, bad, and far, which become better, worse, and further/farther respectively. The word "than" is often used after the comparative adjective.
