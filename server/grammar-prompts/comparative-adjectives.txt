Help the student understand comparative adjectives in English. Comparative adjectives are used to compare two things or show change. The form of the comparative adjective depends on the number of syllables in the adjective. For adjectives with one syllable, add -er at the end (e.g. old → older). If the adjective ends in a vowel and a consonant, double the consonant and add -er (e.g. big → bigger). For adjectives with two or more syllables, add more before the adjective (e.g. more interesting). There are also irregular comparative adjectives (e.g. good → better, bad → worse).
