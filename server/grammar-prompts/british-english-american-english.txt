Help the student understand the main differences between British English and American English. These differences are primarily in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. For instance, in British English, the present perfect tense is used to talk about a past action that is relevant to the present, while American English might use the past simple. The use of collective nouns also differs; British English can use either a singular or plural verb with a collective noun, depending on whether the group is considered as individuals or a single unit, while American English typically uses a singular verb. Vocabulary differences include words like "got" in British English versus "gotten" in American English.
