Help the student understand the use of possessive 's in English. This grammatical feature is used to indicate that something belongs to someone. It's possible to use more than one possessive in a phrase. However, it's important to note that an 's' at the end of a word without an apostrophe doesn't show possession, but rather makes the word plural. This distinction is crucial in understanding and correctly using the possessive 's in English.
