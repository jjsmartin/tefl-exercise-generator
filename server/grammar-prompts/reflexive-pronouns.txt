Help the student understand that reflexive pronouns are used when the subject and the object of a verb are the same. The reflexive pronouns in English are myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, and themselves. For example, in the sentence "I cut myself when I was making dinner last night", 'I' is the subject and 'myself' is the reflexive pronoun used as the object. Reflexive pronouns can also be used for emphasis, especially when it's unusual or different, or to emphasize that someone does it personally. They can also be used together with the noun they refer to for emphasis.
