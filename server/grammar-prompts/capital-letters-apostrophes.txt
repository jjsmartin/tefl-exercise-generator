Help the student understand the correct usage of capital letters and apostrophes in English. Capital letters are used for days of the week, months, festivals, names of people and places, languages, nationalities, adjectives referring to people or things from a specific place, religions, titles, and names of institutions. When a person's job title precedes their name, both should be capitalized. Apostrophes are used to show contractions or possession. In contractions, they indicate missing letters. For possession, 's is used after the possessor's name, regardless of whether it's singular or plural.
