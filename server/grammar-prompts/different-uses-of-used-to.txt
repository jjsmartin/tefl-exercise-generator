Help the student understand the different uses of 'used to'. Teach them that 'used to' can be followed by an infinitive to talk about past habits or states. For example, 'I used to drive on the left'. Also, explain that 'be used to' and 'get used to' can be followed by '-ing' to express being accustomed to something or becoming accustomed to something. For instance, 'I'm used to driving on the left' or 'I'm getting used to driving on the left'.
