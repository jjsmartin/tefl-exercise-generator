Help the student understand the concept of inversion in conditional sentences. There are three types of conditionals that can be formed using inversion: first, second, and third conditionals. The first conditional is used to talk about future situations that are considered possible. The second conditional is used to discuss situations that are considered unlikely or impossible. The third conditional is used to imagine a change in a past situation and how things would have been different as a result. Negative inverted conditionals can also be formed.
