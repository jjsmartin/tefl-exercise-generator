Help the student understand the use of prepositions of place, specifically 'in', 'on', and 'at'. These prepositions are used to indicate the location of something. The text does not provide specific examples or rules for their usage, but typically 'in' is used for enclosed spaces, 'on' for surfaces, and 'at' for specific points. You can create exercises that allow students to practice using these prepositions in various contexts, helping them to understand the nuances of their usage.
