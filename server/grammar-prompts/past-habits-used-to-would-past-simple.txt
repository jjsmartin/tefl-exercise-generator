Help the student understand the use of 'used to', 'would' and the past simple in expressing past habits. 'Used to' is used to talk about things in the past that are no longer true, for example, "I used to live in New York when I was a kid." 'Would' is used to describe repeated actions in the past, such as "Every Saturday I would go on a long bike ride." The past simple is used to describe actions that happened only once in the past, like "I went to Egypt in 2014."
