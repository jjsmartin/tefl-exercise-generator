Help the student understand that participle clauses are used when the participle and the verb in the main clause have the same subject. They do not have a specific tense, which is indicated by the verb in the main clause. Present participle clauses have a similar meaning to active verbs, while past participle clauses usually have a passive meaning. Perfect participle clauses show that the action they describe was finished before the action in the main clause. Participle clauses can also be used after conjunctions and prepositions. They are mainly used in written texts, particularly in a literary, academic or journalistic style.
