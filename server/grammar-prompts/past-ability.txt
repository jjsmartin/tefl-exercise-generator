Help the student understand the concept of expressing past ability in English. Teach them that 'could' and 'couldn't' are used to express general ability in the past. For successful abilities on one occasion, use 'was/were able to', 'had the ability to', 'managed to', or 'succeeded in doing something difficult'. For unsuccessful abilities on one occasion, use 'wasn't/weren't able to', 'didn't manage to', or 'couldn't'. Reinforce these concepts with exercises to test their understanding.
