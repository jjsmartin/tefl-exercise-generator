Help the student understand the difference between the present perfect simple and present perfect continuous. The present perfect simple usually focuses on the result of an activity, while the present perfect continuous focuses on the activity itself. For example, "We've painted the bathroom" (simple) versus "We've been painting the room" (continuous). The simple form often describes a completed action and can indicate 'how many', while the continuous form describes an ongoing activity and can indicate 'how long'. The continuous form can also emphasize that a situation is temporary.
