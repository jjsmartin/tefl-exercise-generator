Help the student understand the concept of reported speech and the use of reporting verbs. Explain that reporting verbs are used to tell someone what another person said. For instance, 'she persuaded me to come' is an example of reported speech where 'persuaded' is the reporting verb. Other examples of reporting verbs include 'tell', 'ask', 'advise', 'agree', 'challenge', 'claim', 'decide', 'demand', 'encourage', 'invite', 'offer', 'promise', 'refuse', 'remind', 'order', 'instruct', 'direct', 'warn', 'admit', 'apologise for', 'complain about', 'deny', 'insist on', 'mention', and 'suggest'. These verbs can be followed by an infinitive or -ing form depending on the context.
