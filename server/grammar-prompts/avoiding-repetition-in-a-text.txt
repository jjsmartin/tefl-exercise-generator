Avoiding repetition in a text

Help the student understand the nuances of avoiding repetition in English. "It" refers to a previously discussed subject with no special emphasis. For distinction, "this" highlights new or notable information, while "that" implies more distance from a subject or represents 'the one' in formal settings. "Such" in official contexts refers to a type previously mentioned. The term "do so" in formal writing substitutes action verbs to avoid repeating them. Encouraging students to use synonyms can also enrich their text, offering variety while conveying the same message.
