Help the student understand the difference between countable and uncountable nouns in English. Countable nouns are individual objects that we can count with numbers such as 'an apple', 'two apples', 'three apples'. They can be used with 'a', 'an', 'some', 'any', and questions can be formed with 'how many'. Uncountable nouns, on the other hand, are substances or concepts we cannot count, like 'bread', 'rice', 'coffee', 'information', 'money', 'advice', 'luggage', 'furniture'. They can be used with 'some', 'any', and questions can be formed with 'how much'. Other expressions of quantity like 'a lot of', 'lots of', 'many', 'much', 'not many', 'not much' can also be used with both types of nouns.
