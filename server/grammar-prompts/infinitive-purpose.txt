Help the student understand the concept of the infinitive of purpose in English grammar. This is used to explain why something is done. For example, the word 'to' followed by a verb can be used to express the purpose of an action. In the sentence "I study to improve my English", 'to improve' is an infinitive of purpose. It explains why the action 'I study' is performed. Encourage the students to practice using infinitives of purpose in their own sentences and provide exercises for them to test their understanding.
