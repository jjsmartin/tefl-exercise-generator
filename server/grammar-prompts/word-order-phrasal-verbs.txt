Help the student understand that phrasal verbs in English are made of a verb plus one or two particles and can be either separable or inseparable. Separable phrasal verbs are transitive and can take a direct object, which can be placed between the verb and particle or after the particle. However, in spoken English, separation is preferred when the speaker stresses the particle. If the object is long or structurally complex, the verb and particle are usually kept together. Non-separable phrasal verbs cannot be separated and if they have a preposition as a particle, the object must follow the preposition.
