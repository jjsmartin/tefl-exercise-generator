Help the student understand the importance of avoiding repetition in a text. Teach them the use of words like 'it', 'this', 'that', 'those', 'such', and 'do so' to refer back to something previously mentioned, thus avoiding unnecessary repetition. For example, 'it' can be used to refer to a previously mentioned situation or event, 'this' and 'these' can refer to a previously mentioned idea or situation, and 'that' and 'those' can refer to something mentioned earlier in the conversation. 'Such' can be used to refer to similar items or situations, and 'do so' can replace a previously mentioned action. Also, encourage the use of synonyms to avoid repetition and make the text more interesting.
