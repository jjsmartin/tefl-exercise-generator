Help the student understand that certain adjectives in English are typically used with specific prepositions. There are no set grammatical rules for which preposition is used with which adjective, so it's beneficial to learn them together. For instance, adjectives like 'interested', 'similar', 'brilliant', 'angry', 'good', 'bad', 'amazing', 'terrible', 'excited', 'happy', 'nervous', 'sad', 'stressed', 'worried', 'afraid', 'frightened', 'scared', 'proud', 'married', 'addicted', 'allergic', 'friendly', 'nice', 'polite', 'rude', 'famous', 'responsible', 'experienced', and 'involved' are often used with prepositions such as 'in', 'to', 'at', 'about', 'of', and 'for'. Encourage students to practice using these combinations in sentences or phrases.
