Help the student understand the difference between adjectives ending in '-ed' and '-ing'. Explain that '-ed' adjectives describe emotions and feelings, and are used to express how people feel. For example, 'bored', 'interested', 'annoyed', 'confused', 'disappointed', 'excited', 'frightened', 'surprised', 'tired', and 'worried'. On the other hand, '-ing' adjectives describe the things or situations that cause the emotions. For instance, 'boring', 'interesting', 'annoying', 'confusing', 'disappointing', 'exciting', 'frightening', 'surprising', 'tiring', and 'worrying'. Encourage them to practice using these adjectives in sentences to solidify their understanding.
