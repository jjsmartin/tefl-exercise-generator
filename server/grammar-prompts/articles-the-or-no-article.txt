Help the student understand the use of articles in English, specifically 'the' or no article. Explain that we commonly use articles in phrases and place names. For instance, we use 'the' before school, prison, and hospital. However, we don't normally use an article for continents, most countries, cities, towns, lakes, mountains, or universities. For example, we say 'University of Cape Town', 'University of Delhi', 'University of Tokyo' without an article before 'University'. Reinforce this understanding through grammar exercises.
