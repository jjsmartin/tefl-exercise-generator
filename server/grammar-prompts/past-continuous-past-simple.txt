Help the student understand the use of past continuous and past simple tenses in English. The past continuous tense shows an action that was already in progress at a certain time in the past, and can also indicate that an activity was in progress for some time. The past simple tense is used to show an action that happened in the middle of the past continuous action, while it was in progress. When used together, these tenses can show an action interrupting another action. For example, "While I was studying, I suddenly felt sleepy."
