Help the student understand that phrasal verbs are common in English, particularly in informal contexts. They consist of a verb and a particle, or sometimes two particles, which often changes the meaning of the verb. There are two types of phrasal verbs: separable and inseparable. Separable phrasal verbs can be split by their object, but must be separated when using a personal pronoun. Inseparable phrasal verbs cannot be split, even when using a personal pronoun. Some phrasal verbs with two particles are also inseparable, with the personal pronoun placed after the particles.
