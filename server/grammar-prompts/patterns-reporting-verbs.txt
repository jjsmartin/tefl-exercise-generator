Help the student understand the use of reporting verbs in English. Each reporting verb requires a different pattern after it, and more than one pattern is possible after some verbs. Some verbs are immediately followed by another verb in infinitive form, such as 'refuse to accept', 'promised not to share', 'agree', 'claim', 'demand', 'offer', 'promise', 'refuse', 'threaten'. Some verbs need an object between the reporting verb and the infinitive, like 'ordered the police to release', 'warns governments not to delay', 'advise', 'ask', 'encourage', 'invite', 'order', 'remind', 'tell', 'urge', 'warn'. Other verbs are followed by '-ing', '-ing', 'that', 'that', 'that', 'that'.
