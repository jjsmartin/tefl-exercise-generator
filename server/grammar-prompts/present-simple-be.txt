Help the student understand the present simple form of the verb 'to be'. In the affirmative form, use 'I am', 'You/we/they are', and 'He/she/it is'. In the negative form, use 'I am not', 'You/we/they are not', and 'He/she/it is not'. Questions are formed by inverting the subject and verb, as in 'Am I?', 'Are you/we/they?', and 'Is he/she/it?'. Contractions are commonly used in spoken English, such as 'I'm', 'You're', 'He's', 'We're', 'They're', 'I'm not', 'She's not', 'We aren't', and 'They aren't'. Short answers to questions can also be contracted.
