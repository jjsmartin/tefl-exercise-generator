Help the student understand that expressing different degrees of certainty about the future in English can be achieved using modal verbs and other expressions. For instance, "will definitely" and "definitely won't" are used when one is very sure about something. "Will" and "won't" are used when one is sure. "Probably" and "probably won't" are used when one is almost sure. "Might", "may", "could", "may not", and "could not" are used when one is not sure. Other expressions like "be bound to", "be likely to", "think", and "doubt" can also be used to express varying degrees of certainty.
