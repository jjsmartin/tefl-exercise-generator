Help the student understand that question tags are often used when we expect the listener to agree with our statement. If the statement is positive, we use a negative question tag and vice versa. The intonation of the question tag can vary depending on how sure we are that the listener will confirm our statement. If there is an auxiliary verb in the statement, we use it to form the question tag. If there is no auxiliary verb, we use 'do' or 'does'. If the verb in the statement is a modal verb, we use the modal verb to make the question tag.
