Help the student understand the use of 'there is' and 'there are' in English. 'There is' is used for singular nouns, while 'there are' is used for plural nouns. For example, 'There is a bridge in the park' or 'There are two cafés in the shopping centre'. The negative forms are 'there isn't' and 'there aren't'. For example, 'There isn't a pharmacy near the hotel' or 'There aren't any restaurants near the hotel'. Questions are formed with 'Is there' or 'Are there'. For example, 'Is there a café near here?' or 'Are there any toilets in the park?'.
