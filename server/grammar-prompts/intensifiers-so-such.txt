Help the student understand the use of intensifiers 'so' and 'such' in English grammar. Explain that 'so' is used with adjectives and adverbs, and can also be used to express a result with 'so that'. On the other hand, 'such' is used with nouns. Also, clarify that 'so' and 'such' can be used with 'much', 'many', 'little', and 'few' to intensify the meaning. Provide exercises for the students to practice the use of these intensifiers in different contexts.
