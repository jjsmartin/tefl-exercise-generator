Help the student understand the use of 'as' and 'like' in English. 'As' is used in comparisons, with structures such as 'as + adjective + as' and 'as much as'. It can also be used to indicate similarity ('Your phone is the same as mine'), to give examples ('such as'), and to talk about a job or function. 'As' can also connect two phrases, where it can mean 'because', 'while' or 'during the time that', and 'in the way that'. 'Like' is used before a noun to make comparisons, and can also be used in the phrases 'as if' and 'as though'.
