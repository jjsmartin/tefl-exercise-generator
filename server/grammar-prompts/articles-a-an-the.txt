Help the student understand the use of articles 'a', 'an', and 'the' in English. Explain that these articles are used before singular nouns. For instance, 'a' and 'an' are used when the noun is not specific, while 'the' is used for specific nouns. When talking about things in general, usually a plural or uncountable noun with no article is used. However, when referring to particular groups of things, 'the' is used. For example, "We went to the zoo and saw the kangaroos." Provide exercises for practice to reinforce these concepts.
