Help the student understand that the meaning of certain verbs can change depending on whether they are followed by '-ing' or an infinitive. For instance, 'stop doing something' and 'stop to do something' have different implications. Similarly, 'try doing something' and 'try to do something' can convey different meanings. The same applies to 'remember doing something' versus 'remember to do something' and 'forget doing something' versus 'forget to do something'. Encourage students to practice these patterns with various verbs to grasp the nuances in meaning.
