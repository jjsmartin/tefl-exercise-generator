Conditionals: third and mixed

Help the student understand the use of third and mixed conditionals in English. Third conditionals are utilized to imagine a different outcome in the past based on a hypothetical situation. They typically follow the structure: If + past perfect >> would have + past participle. For example: "If I had understood the instructions, I would have passed the exam." Mixed conditionals, on the other hand, combine past and present situations. The Past/Present structure, like "If I hadn't got the job, I wouldn't be with my partner," uses If + past perfect >> would + infinitive. Meanwhile, the Present/Past structure, exemplified by "If it wasn't important, I wouldn't have called you," uses If + past simple >> would have + past participle. Conditionals describe results based on certain conditions, with the 'if' clause highlighting the condition and the main clause indicating the result.
