Help the student understand that modal verbs can be used for deduction, which is guessing if something is true based on the available information. The choice of modal verb indicates the level of certainty about the possibility. This concept is applicable when making deductions about the present or future. The modal verbs used for this purpose include 'must', 'might', 'may', 'could', and 'can't'. Each of these verbs conveys a different degree of certainty. Provide exercises for the students to practice using these modal verbs in the correct context.
