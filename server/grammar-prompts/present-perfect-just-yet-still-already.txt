Help the student understand the usage of 'just', 'yet', 'still' and 'already' in the present perfect tense. 'Just' is used to express something that happened a short time ago, 'yet' is used in negative sentences and questions to talk about things that we expect to happen but which have not happened yet, 'still' is used to show that something hasn't changed or stopped happening, and 'already' is used to show that something has happened sooner than it was expected to happen. Provide exercises to test their understanding of these adverbs in different contexts.
