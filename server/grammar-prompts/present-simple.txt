Help the student understand the use of the present simple tense in English. This tense is used to talk about things we do regularly, such as habits or routines (e.g., "I drink coffee at work"). It is also used for things which are generally true (e.g., "She loves to work at home now"). The present simple tense can be used in affirmative, negative, and question forms. For example, "Do you watch a lot of films?" or "He doesn't have a lot of free time". Short answers can also be given using the present simple tense, such as "Yes, I do" or "No, she doesn't".
