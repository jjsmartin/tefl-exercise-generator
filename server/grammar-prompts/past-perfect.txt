Help the student understand the use of the past perfect tense in English. This tense is used to show the order of two past events, with the past perfect indicating the earlier action and the past simple indicating the later action. For example, in the sentence "The thief had escaped", the past perfect tense is used to show that the escape happened before some other past event. However, if there's only a single event, the past perfect is not used, even if it happened a long time ago. Adverbs like 'already', 'still', 'just', 'ever', and 'never' can be used with the past perfect tense.
