Help the student understand that reported speech is used to tell someone what another person asked. This can be done using direct or indirect speech. For example, 'Do you work from home?' can be reported as 'He asked me if I worked from home.' The word 'if' or 'whether' is often used to introduce reported yes-no questions, while question words (what, where, why, who, when, how) are used in reported information questions. Reporting verbs such as 'ask', 'enquire', 'want to know', and 'wonder' can be used. Offers, requests, and suggestions can also be reported, for example, 'Would you like me to help you?' can be reported as 'He offered to help me.'
