Help the student understand that non-defining relative clauses provide extra information about the person or thing mentioned. These clauses are used to give additional details that are not essential to the meaning of the sentence. They are introduced by relative pronouns such as 'who', 'which', 'whose', 'when', 'where', and 'that'. For example, in the sentence "Jack, who's retired now, spends a lot of time with his grandchildren", the clause "who's retired now" is a non-defining relative clause providing extra information about Jack.
