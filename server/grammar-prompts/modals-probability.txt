Help the student understand the use of modal verbs and other expressions to indicate probability or certainty in English. Teach them that 'must' and 'be bound to' are used to express certainty, while 'can't' is used to express impossibility. Explain that 'should', 'shouldn't', 'might', 'may', 'could', and their negative forms are used to express degrees of uncertainty. Lastly, 'can' is used to express general possibility. Reinforce these concepts with interactive exercises and examples.
