Help the student understand that stative verbs describe a state rather than an action. They are not usually used in the present continuous form. Examples of stative verbs include: agree, believe, doubt, guess, imagine, know, mean, recognise, remember, suspect, think, understand, dislike, hate, like, love, prefer, want, wish, appear, be, feel, hear, look, see, seem, smell, taste, belong, have, measure, own, possess, and weigh. Some verbs can refer to states or actions, depending on the context. For instance, 'have' can be used to express possession (I have an old car) or an action in progress (I'm having a quick break).
