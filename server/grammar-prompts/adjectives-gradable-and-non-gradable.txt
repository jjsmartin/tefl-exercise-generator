Adjectives: gradable and non-gradable

Help the student understand that it is possible to use modifiers with some adjectives to make them stronger or weaker -- for example "very" or "rather".

But some adjectives cannot be modified like that: perhaps because they are binary conditions or because they have an inherent meaning that is extreme in some way.

Use very short sentences.
