Help the student understand that defining relative clauses provide essential information about the person or thing mentioned. These clauses often use relative pronouns such as 'who', 'which', 'that', 'when', 'where', and 'whose'. However, the relative pronoun can sometimes be omitted, particularly when it is followed by a verb. Use examples and interactive exercises to reinforce this concept and allow students to practice identifying and using defining relative clauses correctly.
