Capital letters

Help the student understand the correct usage of capital letters and apostrophes in English. Capital letters are essential for starting sentences, the pronoun 'I', days, months, holidays, names of people and places, titles, names of institutions, languages, nationalities, and religions. For instance, Thursday, Christmas, Canada, and Ramadan all require capitalization. Apostrophes indicate contractions or possession. In contractions, they show missing letters, such as "it's" for "it is". For possession, use 's after singular nouns and plural nouns not ending in 's', and only an apostrophe after plural nouns ending in 's'. For example, "cat's toy" versus "parents' house". Remember, "its" shows possession while "it's" is a contraction.
