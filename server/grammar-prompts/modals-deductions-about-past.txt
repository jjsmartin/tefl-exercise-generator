Help the student understand that modal verbs can be used for deduction, which is guessing if something is true based on available information. The choice of modal verb indicates how certain we are about the possibility. This exercise focuses on making deductions about the past. The modal verbs used for this purpose include "must have", "might have", "may have", "could have", "can't have", and "couldn't have". Each of these modal verbs conveys a different level of certainty about a past event.
