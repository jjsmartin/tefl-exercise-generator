British English and American English

Help the student understand the key grammatical differences between British and American English. Firstly, while British English employs the present perfect to describe a relevant past action, American English often prefers the past simple, especially with adverbs like "already," "just," and "yet." Secondly, while "got" is the past participle of "get" in British English, Americans use "gotten" â€“ except in the context of possession. Thirdly, British English may use singular or plural verbs with collective nouns, considering the group's perceived unity; however, American English mainly uses singular verbs. Fourthly, while British English uses "have" or "take" with actions like taking a shower, American English exclusively uses "take." Lastly, the modal "shall" in offering or suggesting in British English is rare in American English, which instead employs alternatives like "Can I" or "How about."
