Help the student understand the concept of 'unreal time' in English grammar. This refers to imagined, wished for, or unlikely situations. When discussing these situations, verb forms often shift backwards. For instance, present tense changes to past, and past tense changes to past perfect. This shift in tense indicates a distance from reality. Various phrases such as 'wish/if only', 'it's (high) time', 'as if/as though', and 'would rather' are used to express unreal time. When the subjects of two clauses are different, unreal tenses are often used. Provide exercises for practice to reinforce this concept.
