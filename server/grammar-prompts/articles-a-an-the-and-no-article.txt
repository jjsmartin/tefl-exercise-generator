Articles: 'a', 'an', 'the', and no article

The student should know that we use:
'an' if the next work begins with a vowel
'a' or 'an' when we mention something for the first time. 
'the' with rivers but not with countries
and so on. 

Consider that many languages use articles but may have different rules. Consider also that some languages do not use articles at all.
