Help the student understand that in English, questions are often formed by placing the verb before the subject, a process known as inversion. For example, "I am" becomes "Am I". This rule applies to verbs such as "be", "can", "will", "should", and "might". In the present simple and past simple tenses, "do", "does", and "did" are used to form questions. For instance, "You work at home" becomes "Do you work at home?". Subject questions often start with "who" or "what", such as "Who broke the window?".
