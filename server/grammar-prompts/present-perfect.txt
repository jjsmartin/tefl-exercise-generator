Help the student understand the use of the present perfect tense in English. This tense is used to describe actions that have happened at an unspecified time before now, or that started in the past and continue to the present. It is formed with 'have/has' and the past participle of the verb. The present perfect can express unfinished time and states, past actions with a result in the present, and experiences or changes over time. It can also be used with time expressions like 'ever', 'never', 'for', 'since', 'just', 'recently', 'already', 'yet', and 'still'.
