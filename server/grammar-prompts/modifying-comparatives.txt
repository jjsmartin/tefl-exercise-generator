Help the student understand that in English, there are several ways to modify comparisons to show big or small differences. Comparative adjectives are used to compare different things, using phrases like 'as … as', 'not as … as', 'different from', 'similar to', and 'the same as'. To show big differences, phrases like 'much', 'so much', 'a lot', 'even', 'far', 'nowhere near as … as', and 'completely different from' are used. Small differences can be shown using 'slightly', 'a little', 'a bit', 'almost', 'nearly', 'not quite', 'roughly', 'more or less', 'about as … as', 'the same as', and 'very similar to'. To show no difference, 'exactly the same as' and 'just as … as' are used.
