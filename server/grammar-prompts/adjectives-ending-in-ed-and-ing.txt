Adjectives ending in -ed and -ing

Help the student understand that adjectives ending in -ed and -ing can have very different meanings. For example "bored" and "boring", "interested" and "interesting".

When creating this gap-fill exercise, focus on the distinction between adjectives ending in -ed and -ing. For each question, provide a sentence with a blank where an adjective should be. The adjective should be one that has both an -ed and an -ing form and is relevant to the context of the sentence.

Next, you'll create two options for each question: one correct and one incorrect. The correct option will be the appropriate adjective for the context of the sentence, and the incorrect option will be the other form of the same adjective. For example, if the correct adjective is 'excited', the incorrect option will be 'exciting', and vice versa.

Remember, the goal of the exercise is to help students understand the different meanings and uses of adjectives ending in -ed (which generally describe feelings) and -ing (which generally describe the thing or person causing the feelings). Therefore, the incorrect option should still be a grammatically possible choice, but one that does not fit semantically in the context of the sentence. This will ensure that the exercise is challenging and effective in reinforcing this grammar point.

Finally, provide an explanation for each question, explaining why the correct option is appropriate and why the incorrect one is not. This will give students insight into their mistakes and aid in their understanding.

Please note that while most gap-fill exercises include multiple incorrect options, for the purposes of this exercise and to highlight the distinction between -ed and -ing adjectives, you're only providing one incorrect option for each question.
