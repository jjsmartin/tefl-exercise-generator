Help the student understand that English grammar can use different structures to add emphasis to a sentence or a part of it. Cleft sentences are used to emphasize a specific part of a sentence by using 'it' or 'what'. For example, "It was you who invited me to the party yesterday." Inversion with negative adverbials is another method, which gives a more formal and impressive effect. For instance, "Rarely have I read such an original story." Lastly, in spoken English, emphatic auxiliaries are often used to stress the auxiliary verb, such as "I am coming!" or "I did like some of it."
