Help the student understand the different future forms in English: 'will', 'be going to', and present continuous. 'Will' is used for spontaneous plans, such as "I'll do it after dinner." 'Be going to' is used for pre-decided plans, for example, "I'm going to phone Mum after dinner." The present continuous is used for arrangements that are already confirmed with at least one other person and when the time and place are known, such as "I'm meeting Jane at 8 o'clock on Saturday." These forms help to express different types of future plans and arrangements.
