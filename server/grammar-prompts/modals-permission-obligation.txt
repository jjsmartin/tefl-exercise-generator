Help the student understand the use of modal verbs in expressing permission and obligation in English. Teach them that 'can', 'could', and 'may' are used to grant permission, while 'can't' and 'mustn't' are used to express prohibition. Explain that 'have to' and 'must' are used to express obligation, often referred to as 'external obligation'. Make sure they understand that 'must' is also used to express personal obligation. Finally, teach them that 'don't have to' is used to express lack of obligation. Use examples and exercises to reinforce these concepts.
