Help the student understand the difference between gradable and non-gradable adjectives in English. Gradable adjectives can be modified to express different degrees of a quality, for example, 'a bit cold', 'very cold', 'extremely cold'. Some common modifiers for gradable adjectives include 'a little/a bit', 'pretty/quite', 'really/very', and 'extremely'. Non-gradable adjectives, on the other hand, cannot be modified to express different degrees. They are either absolute, like 'dead' or 'finished', or extreme, like 'amazing' or 'awful'. Modifiers for non-gradable adjectives include 'absolutely/totally/completely' and 'really'.
