Help the student understand the use of zero, first, and second conditionals in English. The zero conditional is used to talk about things that are generally true, especially for laws and rules. The first conditional is used when discussing future situations that are believed to be real or possible. The second conditional is used to imagine present or future situations that are impossible or unlikely in reality. Each conditional has specific trigger words, such as 'if', 'when', 'unless', 'as long as', 'as soon as', 'in case', 'would', and 'were'.
