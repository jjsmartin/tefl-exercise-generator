Help the student understand the concept of reported speech, which is when we tell someone what another person said. This can be done using direct or indirect speech. In indirect speech, present simple changes to past simple, present continuous to past continuous, and present perfect to past perfect. Past simple usually changes to past perfect simple, and past continuous to past perfect continuous. However, if what the speaker has said is still true or relevant, it's not always necessary to change the tense. Pronouns, demonstratives, and adverbs of time and place also usually change in indirect speech.
